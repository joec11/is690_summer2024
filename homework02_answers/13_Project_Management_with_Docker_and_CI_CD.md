## Project Management with Docker and CI/CD

13. **Describe the role of GitHub Actions in your project's CI/CD pipeline. How do you automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions?**
<p>

The role of GitHub Actions in the project's CI/CD pipeline is to automate testing of the code to ensure that the application is functioning as expected and that it is being built and deployed automatically to upload the latest image to DockerHub. Testing is automated once the latest code changes are pushed to the main branch or there is a pull request to merge to the main branch. If testing succeeds, then the next step is to build and deploy the new image to DockerHub. The new image will be deployed to DockerHub if building and deploying is successful.
