## Project Management with Docker and CI/CD

12. **Discuss the advantages of using Docker Compose for running your project. How does it help in maintaining a consistent development and deployment environment?**
<p>

The advantages of using Docker Compose for running a project is that it allows you to create containers for applications to make it easier to manage and run these applications. Docker Compose can also be used to replicating development environment, specify and manage dependencies with YAML configuration files, isolate processes and resources for containers, scale applications, maintain version control, and deploying an application with a build and run command.

Docker Compose helps maintain a consistent development and deployment environment where each component of the application is encapsulated in a container and dependencies are managed. Docker Compose also provides tools for replication and scaling.
