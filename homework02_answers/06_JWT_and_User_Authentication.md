## JWT and User Authentication

6. **Explain the functioning of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in user authentication. How are JWTs generated, encoded, and used within the project?**
   - [Read this article and link to the code in the user management.](https://supertokens.com/blog/what-is-jwt)
   - Include a code snippet showing how JWTs are implemented in the project.

<br>
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a method to transmit information securely as a JSON object and are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

A JWT is generated with the user's information by the server when a user authenticates with the server.

A specific algorithm, such as HS256 or RSA, encodes the JWT into a string with a secret key.

A JWT can be stored by the client in local storage or in a cookie, can have an expiration time, and can have an authorization role.
