## Pytest

5. **Why is Pytest critical for the development of the API?**
<p>

Pytest is critical for the development of the API because it allows for developers to test code before deploying it to ensure that the aplication will work correctly. Developers can write unit test and test cases to test methods and functions of classes that are used to make objects for the application. Pytest allows for testing segments of code without running the entire program.
