## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

17. **Explain the different user roles defined in your project (ANONYMOUS, AUTHENTICATED, MANAGER, ADMIN) and their permissions.**
<p>

The different user roles which are ANONYMOUS, AUTHENTICATED, MANAGER, and ADMIN, that are defined in the project each have different permissions associated with them.

Individual users that are assigned the ANONYMOUS role only have the ability to perform login and registration (Login and Registration) and only use the "PUT /myaccount/ Update Myaccount" API endpoint under (My Account).

Individual users that are assigned the AUTHENTICATED role only have the ability to perform login and registration (Login and Registration) and get/update their own accounts (My Account).

Individual users that are assigned the role of ADMIN or MANAGER have the permission to manage users (User Management), manage events (Event Management), perform login and registration (Login and Registration), and get/update their own accounts (My Account).
